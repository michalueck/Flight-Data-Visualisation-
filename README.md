# Flight-Data-Visualisation - analysis of US 2008 flight data 

Summary: 

For the data visualization project I decided to work with the RITA flight data provided by http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html. I choose the year 2008. First step for me was to build an sql - lite database to explore on the data. On the site you find an overview on the variables provided. Additionally to the csv for the yearly data, the website also provides supplemental data for the airports, carriers, etc. 

Aim of the project is to show how data can be transformed into a meaningful graphic. 

Clearly summary of the feedback is, that the animated graphs are much more liked by the feedback givers. And this is clearly a field for further learning for me as I will have added value in my daily buisness out of it. Following a story to tell was quite a challenge for me and I think Tableau is really a handy tool when it comes to really good animated data stories. For D3 I have absolutely room for improvement. I hope the project is going to meet the reviewer's expectations.
